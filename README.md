# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! 
Here, I've documented my journey of solving various DSA problems across different topics.
This repository serves as a collection of solutions and approaches to a wide range of problems, intended for practice and learning.

## Contents

This repository is organized into several folders, each representing a specific topic or type of problem:

- **Arrays**: Solutions to problems involving array manipulation, searching, sorting, etc.
- **Recurssion**: A collection of problems solved using recurssion techniques.
- **Sorting and Searching**: Implementations of various sorting algorithms and search techniques.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementations and problems related to singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Problems involving stack and queue data structures, including implementations.
- **Trees and Graphs**: Solutions to problems on binary trees, binary search trees, and graph algorithms.
- **Miscellaneous**: Any other problems that don't fit neatly into the above categories.

## How to Use

Each folder contains solutions in a specific programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++). 
You can browse the folders, pick a problem, and review the solution. The goal is to understand the approach and logic behind each solution.
